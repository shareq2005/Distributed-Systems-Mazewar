This is a project for my Distributed Systems class at UofT. The goal of this project was to create a multiplayer version of the Mazewar game using Distributed Systems fundamentals. 

The game is playable with unto 4 players over LAN. The synchronization is done through an implementation of ISIS Vector Clocks, which eliminates the need for a central server.
