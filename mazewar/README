To compile the project use the Makefile. If the Makefile doesn't work, use Eclipse.

First turn the server on. The server waits for 4 clients to connect before sending an acknowledgement 
which makes the Clients start the game.

The direction of the clients initially and after every respawn has been hard coded to South.
This is for simplicity. Rest of the game play is unaffected.

To run the MazewarServer:
	
	java MazewarServer <port_number>
	
To run the Mazewar Client:

	java Mazewar <hostname> <port_number>
